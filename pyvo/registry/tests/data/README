regtap.xml is used as a generic regtap query response in many of
test_regtap's fixtures; most tests don't actually inspect its contents.

To update it (necessary after changes to regtap.get_RegTAP_query), run
this to update it:

import requests
from pyvo.registry import regtap

with open("regtap.xml", "wb") as f:
	f.write(requests.get(regtap.REGISTRY_BASEURL+"/sync", {
		"LANG": "ADQL",
		"QUERY": regtap.get_RegTAP_query(
			keywords="pulsar", ucd=["pos.distance"])}).content)
